                                Cyclists often sustain injuries to their upper

                          Cyclist inattention is a leading cause of bicycle
                          accidents, often resulting from distractions inside or
                          outside the bicycle. Mobile phone usage, such as
                          texting or making calls while cycling, diverts
                          attention away from the road and increases the
                          likelihood of failing to see obstacles or other

                          crosswalks where cyclists interact. This can stem from
                          a lack of awareness of other cyclists&#x27; presence
                          or a disregard for traffic laws. Improving education

                          Unsafe passing distances by cyclists are a significant
                          concern for cyclist safety, particularly on roads
                          without dedicated bicycle lanes. Cyclists overtaking
                          others without leaving sufficient space can lead to
                          sideswipe collisions or force cyclists to veer off the
                          road to avoid being struck. Factors such as high
                          cycling speeds, narrow roadways, or blind curves can
                          exacerbate the risk of unsafe passing maneuvers.
                          Implementing guidelines or regulations specifying
                          minimum passing distances and increasing education
                          efforts can help protect cyclists from this hazard.

                          Poor road conditions present significant safety
                          challenges for cyclists, affecting their ability to
                          navigate roads safely. Uneven surfaces, potholes, or
                          debris can cause cyclists to lose control or sustain
                          injuries if they collide with obstacles. Moreover,
                          inadequate lighting or poorly marked roadways can
                          reduce cyclists&#x27; visibility, increasing the risk
                          of accidents, particularly at night. Municipalities
                          should prioritize regular road maintenance and
                          improvements to guarantee safer conditions for
                          cyclists and pedestrians.

                              Not necessarily. Many bicycle accident cases are
